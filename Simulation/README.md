# Simulation

## Purpose

This simulation generates .csv data with random values. The purpose is to test processing scripts without requiring the actual device. It uses a real Python application but stubs the low-level Python module that communicates with the device.

# Usage

[Information on how to use this tool can be found in the "Building, running, and stopping a Docker image" and "Running Simulation" sections.](../DevOps/Docker/README.md)
